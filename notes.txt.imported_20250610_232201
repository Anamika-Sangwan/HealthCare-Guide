Doctor: Good morning, Ms. Rao. What brings you in today?

Patient: Good morning, doctor. I’ve been feeling unusually tired for the past few days, and I’ve had a mild fever and sore throat.

Doctor: I see. Any other symptoms—like a cough, body aches, or nasal congestion?

Patient: Yes, a light cough in the mornings and some throat irritation. No major aches though.

Doctor: Alright. Any shortness of breath or chest tightness?

Patient: No, none of that.

Doctor: Have you had any changes in sleep or appetite?

Patient: Yes, both. I’ve been sleeping poorly and eating less than usual.

Doctor: Thank you for the details. Before we continue, I’d like to ask about your family medical history. Does anyone in your immediate family have chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid problems?

Patient: Yes, my father has hypertension, and my mother has type 2 diabetes. No history of asthma or thyroid issues though.

Doctor: Noted. That helps in understanding your background. Now, let’s check your vitals. (Takes temperature, pulse, and blood pressure.) Your temperature is 99.7°F—slightly elevated—but your pulse and blood pressure are normal.

Patient: Okay, that’s not too bad.

Doctor: I’ll also check your throat and lungs. (Uses stethoscope and light.) Your throat is mildly inflamed, but your lungs sound clear.

Patient: That’s a relief.

Doctor: It looks like a mild viral upper respiratory infection. Nothing serious at this point. I’ll prescribe medication to manage your symptoms—an antipyretic for fever, a cough syrup, and lozenges for your throat.

Patient: Do I need to take any tests?

Doctor: Not unless symptoms worsen or last beyond 5–7 days. Just rest well, stay hydrated, and avoid cold drinks.

Patient: Got it. Thank you, doctor.

Doctor: You’re welcome, Ms. Rao. I’ve sent the prescription to the pharmacy. Take care and come back if there’s no improvement.

Patient: Will do. Thanks again!
